# Managed Solution Sitemap Fixer

XrmToolBox plugin for fixing sitemaps in managed solutions exported from CRM. When exporting solutions, which include a sitemap, you don't want to include any unnecessary elements. This is especially true when developing 3rd party addons. 

This tool makes it easy to prepare a valid sitemap and replace the existing one in the exported solution. It's an alternative for extracting the solution zip and doing this by hand each time.

It allows you to load a solution from a zip file. See and edit the included sitemap and put it back into the solution. You can also save and load the edited sitemap.
